            # ROSE suite [roses-u:log:a/a/0/0/0 suite-id]: experiment name
            
            ## Description
            
            **Configuration**: Earth System/ Coupled AOIL/ Atmosphere-only <delete/ amend as appropriate>
            
            |  | Atmosphere | Land   | Ocean   | Sea ice    | Coupled  | Ocean BGC | Land Ice  |

            **Suite revision for start of run**:
            
            **Baseline configuration** <state in the form HadGEM3-GC''x.y''-''resolution'' or UKESM''x.y''-''resolution'' 
            
            **Baseline configuration suite ID & revision**: <This is the original supported suite from which this job descends. You should be able to copy this from predecessor suite since they share the same original ancestor, but double-check that no errors have subsequently been found in the original.>
            
            **Predecessor suite ID:** <the suite from which this one was directly copied>
            
            **Changes from predecessor:** 
            <text description **and** link to suite log ([roses-u:log:a/a/0/0/0]), so that reviewer can check the suite diffs are consistent with what is intended.>
            
            **Initial conditions:** <source run and date>
            
            **Dates covered:** <start date and run length>
            
            **Other configuration specific settings:** <list changes that make this job 
            differ from the standard setup, e.g. use climatological dust>
            
                      
            ## Quality assurance checklists
            
            Please read the [ExperimentGuidance guidance notes](https://github.com/UKNCSP/CMIP7-simulations/blob/main/Experiment_Guidance.md) before completing the table below. Where an ensemble member is copied from a previously-reviewed job for the same experiment, only the first 6 rows of the second table are relevant: the rest can be ignored. 
            
            **Diagnostic configuration**:
            | Task | Date completed | Notes | Reviewed by |
            |---|---|---|---|
            | Suite metadata is compliant (experiment names, ensemble member ID, ...). See [wiki:CMIP6/RoseSuiteMetadata]  | |  |
            | Diagnostic setup appropriate for mip_convert |  |  | |
            | Test data for any new diagnostics has been produced and checked (see [Experiment Guidance](https://github.com/UKNCSP/CMIP7-simulations/blob/main/Experiment_Guidance.md) Note ideally this link should point to a Run Set-Up part of page |  | |
            
            **Science / technical review**:
            | Task | Date completed | Notes | Reviewed by |
            |---|---|---|---|
            | Diagnostic setup correctly configured for this experiment | | Only relevant if this experiment has specific diagnostic requirements  **todo: link to diagnostic documentation when ready** | |
            | Suite revision reviewed corresponds to that in suite description above |  |  |  |
            | All suite changes committed to repository |  | Suite revision reviewed: rNNNN |  |
            | Changes from predecessor suite are documented and consistent with CMIP experimental design (refer to documentation for relevant MIP: [wiki:MIPDocumentation]) | | | |
            | The job is consistent with other related runs (e.g. other ensemble members, historical->SSP continuations) | | | |
            | Start and end dates are correct (see ExperimentGuidance#Runsetup) | | | |
            | Job descended from correct HadGEM3 / UKESM job: baseline configuration suite ID and revision (above) are listed under the appropriate MIP in [wiki:MIPDocumentation] | | This is to minimise the propagation of errors discovered after the first runs have begun. | |
            | If setup deviates from experimental protocol as defined by ES-doc, have these exceptions been recorded above? |  |  |  |
            | Does suite use branches for any component model? | | | |
            | If so has this code been accepted for a future release of the component model? | | | |
            | Have all forcing datasets been reviewed? See [Forcing Data Pages](https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/trac/UKESM/wiki/UKESMAncilWG). | | | |
            
            ## Data locations
            
            **Data in MOOSE:**
            
            ## Comparable Jobs
            
            <Please list comparable jobs that this job should be compared against>
            
            ## Run log
            
            <Please record all crashes, error messages, manual restarts (record model date and whether NRUN or CRUN) and investigations here>
            
            <If you change ancils mid-way through the run (requiring an NRUN), or NRUN for another reason, record here, and commit to the suite including a note on the start date. But when quoting the suite revision number above and for others to copy, quote the revision corresponding to the start of the run.>
            
            <For jobs running under the shared account, please also keep a record of who is looking after the job here>
            
            ## Standard plots
            
            <Please put links to monitoring output (afterburner), Validation Notes, !AutoAssess, ocean_assess and further evaluation output here. Also list a brief summary of the main results of those plots in bullet point form>
            
            ## Extra plots
            
            <Attach extra plots here (optional)>
